    <h1>Turn-Based Game</h1>
    
    <img class="component_left" style="width:63px;" src="../img/turnbased.png" />
    <!--<img class="component_left" style="width: 90pt;" src="img/turn-based_game01_cropped.jpg" />-->
    <p>This turn-based version of building is more cerebral and tactical than classic real-time building. The differences are described here. This explanation assumes you already understand how <a href="building_the_ship.html">building</a> normally works.</p>
    
    <!--
    <img class="screenshot_with_border" src="img/turn-based_game01.jpg" width="50%"  /><br />
    <br />
    -->
    
    <p>Turn-based building uses a more organized warehouse:</p>
    
    <div class="block">
        <img class="screenshot_with_border" src="../img/turn-based_game.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width:1200px;" />
    </div>

    <!--
    <br />
    <div class="block">
        <img class="screenshot_with_border" src="img/turn-based_game_overlay02.jpg" width="100%"  />
    </div>
    -->

</div>



<div class="block">
    <h2>Action Points</h2>
    <p>You have a certain number of action points you can use on your turn. You spend action points to do various things in the warehouse. Costs are given in the illustration.</p>
    
    <p>Up to 3 action points can be saved for your next turn. Each turn, you get 10 action points, plus 0 to 3 points that you saved from your previous turn. (Exception: the first player will have only 7 on his or her first turn.)</p>
    
    <h2>Looking at Cards</h2>
    
    <p><a href="building_the_ship.html#looking_at_cards">Looking</a> at a stack of adventure cards costs 3 to 5 action points, depending on the level of the flight. The cards will not be available on your first turn. They will appear once you start a turn with at least one component added to your ship.</p>
    
    <p>Once you have looked at a stack of cards, you may look at it again as often as you like for free. Stacks you have already seen will be marked. You will also be able to tell which stacks other players have looked at.</p>
    
    <h2>Rearranging Components</h2>
    
    <p>In turn-based building, nothing is welded until you end your turn. You can add components and explore various configurations. If you change your mind, you can return the components and get your action points back.</p>
</div>



<div class="block">
    <h2>Setting Components Aside</h2>
    
    <p>As with real-time building, you have two squares on which you can <a href="building_the_ship.html#storage">set components aside</a>. Storing a component here for later turns costs 1 point.</p>
	
	<p>If you change your mind about storing a new component, you can return it to the conveyor belts and get that point back. Or you can add it to your ship. It costs you 2 points to move the component to your ship, but because you get back the 1 point you would have paid for storage, it looks like the cost is 1 point.</p>
	
	<p>Similarly, if you move a new component from your ship to storage, you get back the 2 points you would have paid for adding it to your ship, but you spend 1 point on storage, so it looks like you gain 1 point.</p>
	
	<p>If a component is left in storage at the end of your turn, you will be unable to return it to the conveyors. However, you will still be able to shuffle it between storage and your ship, paying or gaining 2 action points when you do so.</p>
</div>



<div class="block">
    <h2>Ending Your Turn</h2>
    
    <p>You are allowed to save up to 3 action points for the next turn. If you have more than 3 points left, you must take more actions until you are down to 3 or fewer. The End Turn button will remain dark until you have used enough action points. <span class="tap">When you are done spending action points and have finished arranging your new components, click the button.</span></p>
</div>



<div class="block">
    <h2>Welding</h2>
    
    <p>When you end your turn, any components you have added to your ship will be welded in place. <span class="note_red">You will not be able to move them later.</span></p>
</div>



<div class="block">
    <h2>Finishing Building</h2>
    
    <p>When you have your ship built the way you like it, you may take one of the <a href="building_the_ship.html#finishing_your_ship">numbered tiles</a>. This does not cost any action points.</p>
    
    <p>The counter in the upper left corner works somewhat like the <a href="building_the_ship.html#timer">timer</a> in real-time building. Building will not be over until it has counted down twice. After the first countdown, the counter disappears until someone takes a numbered tile. Then it gives the remaining players a certain number of turns in which to finish building.</p>
    
    <p>Once the timer has counted down twice, or once every player has taken a numbered tile, it is time for the <a href="flight.html">flight</a>. The flight is the same in a turn-based game as it is in a real-time game.</p>
