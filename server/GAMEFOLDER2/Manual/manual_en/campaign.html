    <h1>Campaign</h1>
    
    <p>The campaign is a single-player story set on the frontier of human civilization. You will meet interesting characters, fly challenging missions, and explore this remote corner of the Galaxy.</p>
</div>



<div class="block"> 
    <h2>Galactic Map</h2>
    
    <div class="block"> 
	    <img class="screenshot_with_border" src="../img/campaign01.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width:1200px;" />
    </div>
    <br />
    
    <p>The galactic map shows where you have been and where you might want to go next. Places you have visited are shown in full detail. Places you have yet to visit are represented by question marks. <span class="tap">Click a location to learn more about it</span>.</p>
    
    <p>Your current location is highlighted by a white circle. Yellow exclamation points denote places with new missions and special encounters. <span class="tap">Click your current location to see if you can find anyone to talk to there.</span></p>
    
    <p>Flight routes are displayed as lines with spaceship icons. <span class="tap">Click the icon to take that route.</span></p>
    
    <p>The icon indicates what <a href="building_the_ship.html#ship_class">ship class</a> you need on that route. You start with a license for Class I ships, but you will unlock higher classes during the campaign. This is what the credits are for. You earn credits by transporting goods, defeating enemies, and surviving all those crazy <a href="adventure_cards.html">adventures</a> that await you.</p>
</div>



<div class="block"> 
    <h2>"Winning" the Campaign</h2>
    
    <p>The campaign is a branching story with sub-plots that you make yourself along the way. Are you the trucker who successfully transported the alien diplomat on the very first try? Or are you the trucker who nearly got him killed fifteen times before you finally made it to the unpronounceable homeworld?</p>
    
    <p>It is not possible to make a fatal mistake that causes you to lose the game. Some missions have to happen before others, but you have a lot of freedom to go where you want and experience the story in the order you choose.</p>
	
	<p>The campaign has its own achievement list. You can look at that for hints of encounters you might want to seek out. Explore the Galaxy and have fun!</p>
