    <h2>Open Space</h2>
    
    <img class="adventure_card" src="img/advCards/openspace_w160.png" />
    <p>Open Space is like a wide open drag strip. How fast can you go?</p>
    
    <p>Each ship's potential <a href="building_the_ship__engines.html#engine_strength">engine strength</a> is displayed on the screen. Ships with <a href="building_the_ship__engines.html#double_engines">double engines</a> will have a range of engine strengths displayed because they can choose whether to spend <a href="building_the_ship__batteries.html"> batteries <img src="../img/battery.png" width="7" /></a>.</p>
    
    <p>Players choose their engine strength in order. You will know the strength of the players ahead of you when you make your choice. To power a double engine, <span class="tap">click a battery</span> or <span class="drag_and_drop">drag a battery to a double engine</span>. When you are satisfied, <span class="tap">click the <img src="../img/dialog_ok_cropped.png" alt="green check mark" height="16" /> icon to confirm your engine strength.</span></p>
    
    <div class="small_window">
      <p>It does not matter which double engine you choose to power. They all have the same effect. However, your choice of battery <b>could</b> matter. Some battery components are more vulnerable than others. Try to use up the ones most likely to be knocked off your ship.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Once all engine strengths have been determined, everyone moves ahead that many <a href="flight.html#gaining_and_losing_flight_days">flight days</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Even if you don't care about getting ahead, you still need some <a href="building_the_ship__engines.html">engines</a>. A ship that has engine strength 0 in Open Space must <a href="flight.html#giving_up">give up on the flight</a>.</p>

    <h2>Planets</h2>
    
    <img class="adventure_card" src="img/advCards/planets_w160.png" />
    <p>If you are fortunate, you will encounter a card with 2 to 4 planets where you can land to pick up goods. The leader chooses first, followed by the other players in order.</p>
    
    <p>If you are not sure where to land, you may check your ship's <a href="building_the_ship__cargo_holds.html">cargo holds</a>. <span class="tap">Click your avatar to see your ship details.</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="tap">Click the planet you want to land on</span> and <span class="tap">click the <img src="../img/dialog_ok_cropped.png" alt="green check mark" height="16" /> icon to confirm</span>. Landing on a planet will cost you the number of <a href="flight.html#gaining_and_losing_flight_days">flight days</a> indicated in the bottom right corner of the card. If you don't want to land on any planet, simply <span class="tap">click the <img src="../img/dialog_cancel_cropped.png" alt="cancel" height="16" /> icon</span>. </p>
    
    <div class="small_window">
        <p>No player is required to land. In fact, if there are few planets, the players in the lead may occupy all of them, preventing the others from landing at all. It is legal to land just to take the opportunity away from other players, even if you can’t take any of the goods. (But be sure it is worth the loss of flight days.)</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The players who chose to land <a href="flight.html#getting_goods">load the indicated goods</a> by <span class="tap">clicking the goods</span> or by <span class="drag_and_drop">dragging them</span> to their <a href="building_the_ship__cargo_holds.html">cargo containers</a>.

    <h2>Abandoned Ship</h2>
    
    <img class="adventure_card" src="img/advCards/abandonedship_w160.png" />
    <p>If you find an abandoned ship, you’re in gravy! <span class="note">There is some sort of protocol for reporting these things, but what the heck. Surely some of your crew are sick of you by now and have been saving for a ship of their own. Fix up the abandoned ship and sell it to them for a fair price.</span></p>
    
    <p>Only one player can use this opportunity.

    <img class="adventure_card" src="img/advCards/abandonedstation_w160.png" />
    <p>When fleeing the tragic disaster that befell this space station, the inhabitants probably left behind some good loot. It will take a big crew to search for it, though. To use this opportunity, you must have at least as many crew on board as required by the card.</p>
    
    <p>Only one player can use this opportunity. If no one ahead of you takes it, you can <span class="tap">click the <img src="../img/dialog_ok_cropped.png" alt="green check mark" height="16" /> icon to loot the station!</span> <span class="note">We mean, check for survivors.

It's a humanitarian mission.</span> You will <a href="flight.html#gaining_goods">gain the goods</a> on the space station and lose the indicated number of <a href="flight.html#flight_days">flight days</a>.</p>
    
    <p><b>You do not lose crew.</b> Unlike an <a href="#abandoned_ship">Abandoned Ship</a>, your crew comes back to you after looting. We mean, <i>investigating</i>.</p>

    <a name="meteor_swarm"></a>
    <h2>Meteor Swarm</h2>
    
    <img class="adventure_card" src="img/advCards/meteoric_w160.png" />
    <p>A meteor swarm can really mess with your paint job. This card depicts several large and/or small meteors and the directions they come from. Meteors are dealt with one at a time. They affect each player simultaneously.</p>
    
    <p>For each meteor, the game rolls two dice. The roll determines which row or column the meteor can impact. You will see the result of the meteor threat by the players' avatars and also on the flight track. Some meteors are dealt with automatically. Others might require you to make a decision. Meteors behave according to the following rules:</p>
    
    <a name="small_meteor"></a>
    <h3>Small Meteor</h3>
    <img class="component_left_small" src="../../advCards/icons/meteor_small.png" />
    <p>A small meteor will harmlessly bounce off a well built ship. It is only a problem if it hits an <a href="building_the_ship.html#exposed_connectors">exposed connector</a>. In this case, you can still avoid damage by powering up a <a href="building_the_ship__shield_generators.html">shield</a> if you have one that protects that side. You must pay 1 <a href="building_the_ship__batteries.html">battery&nbsp;<img src="../img/battery.png" width="7" /></a> to do this. If you can’t or won’t defend against the impact, the component the meteor hits is <a href="flight.html#hits_to_your_ship">destroyed</a>.</p>
    
    <a name="large_meteor"></a>
    <h3>Large Meteor</h3>
    <img class="component_left" src="../../advCards/icons/meteor_large.png" />
    <p>A large meteor is, of course, even more dangerous. It will damage even a well built ship and shields cannot stop it. Your only hope is to blast it with a <a href="building_the_ship__cannons.html">cannon</a>. </p>
    
    <p>If the meteor is coming from the <b><u>front</u></b>, you need a cannon in the same column as the meteor. </p>
    <p>If the meteor is coming from the <b><u>side</u></b>, you can hit it with a cannon in that row or either of the two adjacent rows. </p>
    <p>If the meteor is coming from the <b><u>rear</u></b>, you can hit it with a cannon in that column or either of the two adjacent columns.</p>
    
    <!--
    If the meteor is coming from the front, you need a cannon in the same column as the meteor. If the meteor is coming from the side, you can hit it with a cannon in that row or either of the two adjacent rows. If the meteor is coming from the rear, you can hit it with a cannon in that column or either of the two adjacent columns.</p>-->
    
    </p>The game will automatically shoot down any large meteor that can be hit with a simple cannon. If you can hit a large meteor only with a <a href="building_the_ship__cannons.html#double_cannons">double cannon</a>, the game will give you the option to <span class="tap">click a <a href="building_the_ship__batteries.html"> battery&nbsp;<img src="../img/battery.png" width="7" /></a></span> to power the double cannon. If you can’t or won’t blow up the meteor, the component the meteor hits is <a href="flight.html#hits_to_your_ship">destroyed</a>.</p>
    
    <div class="small_window">
        <p>Large meteors tend to come from in front of you, which is one reason we recommend you have every column covered by a forward-pointing cannon.</p>
        <p>But they can come from the side or the rear, too. Always check the <a href="building_the_ship.html#looking_at_cards">adventure forecast</a> during building.</p>
    
        <p>A sideways-pointing cannon covers 3 rows &ndash; its own row and the two adjacent rows. So you might be able to protect an entire side with two or three cannons.</p>
        
        <p>Even if you can't protect every row and column, you can still help yourself by covering those rows and columns most likely to be rolled: 6, 7, and 8.</p>

<div class="block">
    <a name="enemies"></a>
    <a name="smugglers"></a>
    <a name="slavers"></a>
    <a name="pirates"></a>
    <h2>Enemies (Smugglers, Slavers, and Pirates)</h2>
    
    <img class="adventure_card" src="img/advCards/smugglers_w160.png" />
    <p>Enemies pose a threat to everyone, but they attack the players’ ships in order. First, they attack the leader. If they are not defeated, they attack the next player in line, and so on, until they have attacked everyone or until someone defeats them.</p>
    
    <p>The strength of the enemies is given by the number next to the cannon symbol. For example, these smugglers have strength 4. To defeat the enemies you need <a href="building_the_ship__cannons.html#cannon_strength">cannon strength</a> that exceeds this number. If you have less cannon strength, the enemies defeat you.</p>
    
    <p> Your cannon strength will often be counted automatically. If you can win or tie only by using a <a href="building_the_ship__cannons.html#double_cannons">double cannon</a>, the game will give you a chance to spend <a href="building_the_ship__batteries.html">batteries <img src="../img/battery.png" width="7" /></a> to power double cannons.</p>
    
    <p>The top half of the card shows what happens if you lose. For example, if you lose to these Smugglers, they will <a href="flight.html#losing_goods">steal 2 goods</a>. Slavers will <a href="flight.html#losing_crew">take some of your crew members</a>. Pirates will <a href="#cannon_fire">shoot at you</a>. After defeating you, the enemies will move on to the next player in line.</p>
    
    <p>If you tie with the enemies, they will not harm you, but they will still move on to the next player in line.</p>
    
    <p>The bottom half shows what will happen if you win. Sometimes you can earn reward money for defeating the bad guys. If you defeat Smugglers, you <a href="flight.html#gaining_goods">win the indicated goods</a>. As always, if you take the reward you will lose <a href="flight.html#flight_days">flight days</a>. If you don't want the reward, you can <span class="tap">click the <img src="../img/dialog_cancel_cropped.png" alt="cancel" height="16" /> icon</span>.</p>
    
    <p>If you defeat the enemies, they will fly away. They will not attack the next player in line.</p>
    
    <div class="small_window">
      <p>If you have enough cannons to defeat the enemies, you want to be in front so you can claim the reward. If you can't defeat the enemies, you want to be flying behind a trucker who can.</p>
    </div>
</div>    



<div class="block">
    <a name="battle_zone"></a>
    <a name="combat_zone"></a>
    <h2>Combat Zone</h2>
    
    <img class="adventure_card" src="img/advCards/combatzone_w160.png" />
    <p>The true test of any space ship is to fly it through a Combat Zone. Three challenges are evaluated in succession. Each has a criterion and a penalty for the player who is weakest in that area. If multiple players are tied for being weakest, the one who is farthest ahead pays the penalty, so this is one place where it can be be good to be behind.</p>
    
    <p>Let's use this card as an example. The following happens in order:</p>
    
    <ol style="clear:left">
    <li>The player with the fewest <a href="building_the_ship__cabins.html#choosing_crew">crew members</a> loses 3 <a href="flight.html#flight_days">flight days</a>.</li>
    <li>In order, players decide whether to spend <a href="building_the_ship__batteries.html"> batteries <img src="../img/battery.png" width="7" /></a> on <a href="building_the_ship__engines.html#double_engines">double engines</a>. The player with the weakest <a href="building_the_ship__engines.html#engine_strength">engine strength</a> loses two crew members.</li>
    <li>In order, players decide whether to spend <a href="building_the_ship__batteries.html"> batteries <img src="../img/battery.png" width="7" /></a> on  <a href="building_the_ship__cannons.html#double_cannons">double cannons</a>. The player with the weakest <a href="building_the_ship__cannons.html#cannon_strength">cannon strength</a> is threatened by cannon fire from behind.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Each Combat Zone has the same three criteria, but they can be in any order. In addition to the penalties shown here, some Combat Zones might <a href="flight.html#losing_goods">take goods</a> from you.</p>
    
    <div class="block">
        <a name="cannon_fire"></a>
        <h3>Cannon Fire</h3>
        <p>Cannon fire can get quite nasty. Hits from cannon fire work like hits from <a href="adventure_cards.html#meteor_swarm">meteors</a> except they are more difficult to defend against. Each hit has a direction. The game rolls two dice to determine which row or column the hit is coming from, thus determining which component of the ship (if any) is in danger.</p>
	</div>
    
    <div class="block">    
        <a name="light_cannon_fire"></a>
        <h3>Light Cannon Fire</h3>
        <img class="component_left_small" src="../../advCards/icons/shot_small.png" />
        <p>The only way to defend against light cannon fire is with a <a href="building_the_ship__shield_generators.html">shield</a> that protects against hits from that direction. This can be powered at the cost of 1 <a href="building_the_ship__batteries.html">battery&nbsp;<img src="../img/battery.png" width="7" /></a>. Otherwise, the component is <a href="flight.html#hits_to_your_ship">destroyed</a>.</p>

        <img class="component_left" src="../../advCards/icons/shot_large.png" />
        <p><span class="note_red">There is no way to defend against heavy cannon fire.</span> You just have to hope for a roll that misses your ship entirely. Otherwise, the component it hits is <a href="flight.html#hits_to_your_ship">destroyed</a>.</p>

    <h2>Stardust</h2>
    
    <img class="adventure_card" src="img/advCards/stardust_w160.png" />
    <p>Stardust is annoying stuff. It just gets into everything. Each player <a href="flight.html#gaining_and_losing_flight_days">loses 1 flight day</a> for every <a href="building_the_ship.html#exposed_connectors">exposed connector</a>.</p>
</div>

    <a name="epidemic"></a>
    <h2>Epidemic</h2>
    
    <img class="adventure_card" src="img/advCards/epidemic_w160.png" />
    <p>You know how it is. One crew member gets the sniffles and suddenly half your crew is dead. If an Epidemic strikes, you will lose 1 crew member (human or alien) in each occupied <a href="building_the_ship__cabins.html">cabin</a> that is <a href="building_the_ship.html#connectors">joined</a> to another occupied cabin.</p> 
    
    <div class="small_window">
    <p>The safe thing to do is to build your ship so that no two cabins are joined. If you do have connected cabins, you can try to empty one of them before the epidemic strikes. It is very helpful to know if Epidemic is among the adventure cards for that flight, so don't forget to <a href="building_the_ship.html#looking_at_cards">look at the cards</a> during building.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p><span class="note">We have just been informed that the afflicted crew members are not dead. According to Corporation Incorporated, they were all sent home in escape pods and are recovering nicely. Even so, you should probably wash your hands.</span></p>
</div>


<div class="block">
    <a name="sabotage"></a>
    <h2>Sabotage</h2>
    
    <img class="adventure_card" src="img/advCards/sabotage_w160.png" />
    <p>You need many watchful eyes to protect your ship from this stealthy saboteur. The ship with the smallest crew falls victim to Sabotage! If multiple ships are tied for smallest crew, the one in front is sabotaged, so this is another situation in which it might be better to be behind.</p>
    
    <p>The game rolls 2 dice twice to determine the row and column of the attack. If the result is not part of the ship, the game rolls again. If three rolls miss, then the ship escapes the Sabotage! Otherwise, the first component to be hit will be <a href="flight.html#hits_to_your_ship">destroyed</a>.</p>
