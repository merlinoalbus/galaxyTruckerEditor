            	<p>Galaxy Trucker was first published in 2007. It has collected several awards and has become one of the best selling CGE titles with three expansions and a big box anniversary edition. It is well known all around the world and appreciated for the unique and fun game mechanics. It is probably the only game that is really fun to be terrible at. :) </p>

        	<p>If you like the app, you would probably also like the board game, as it gives a similar experience on the table with your friends, family, and even kids. There are no individual player turns, which means that all players are actively engaged and having fun all the time.</p>

            <p>You will be building your cardboard ships, use cute little plastic astronauts and aliens to pilot your ship, collect wooden cargo boxes, use glass batteries to charge your engines and lasers or feel the time pressure by the hourglass. You just need to make the sounds of your ship exploding yourself. (Yes, we know that there is no sound in a vacuum, but who cares).</p>
            
            <p>The game has been published in 10 languages and you can find the game for purchase online or in any good board games store.</p>
