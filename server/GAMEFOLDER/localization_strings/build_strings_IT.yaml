([n4(1:This costs more for higher-level flights.|2:This cost depends on the level of the flight.|3:This costs less for lower-level flights.)]) <br />"

info3Text2: "If you return it or add it to your ship on the same turn, then storage is canceled and your [n(1:point is|2:points are)] refunded."

info4Text1: "You cannot look at the adventure cards until at least 1 component is welded to your ship. (Welding happens after you end your turn.)"

info4Text3: "Once you have seen a stack, you can look at it again for free."
info5Title: "Spending Points"
info5Text1: "You can spend all your action points, or save up to [img(buildScene/point.png)*n] for next turn."
info5Text2: "Tip: It's not a good idea to reveal a new component unless you also have enough action points to add it to your ship."
info5Text3: "When you have spent enough action points, you can end your turn [img(tutorial/endturnbtn.png)]. Or, if you are done building, you can end your turn by taking a number tile [img(ordinalTokens/1.png)], which will start the final countdown."
info6Title: "Final Countdown"
info6Text1: "The final countdown cannot be started until the number in the upper left corner reaches 0."
info6Text2: "You can still take a number [img(ordinalTokens/1.png)]. If you do, the final countdown will start as soon as the first countdown is complete."
info6Text3: "During the final countdown, the number in the upper left corner is red. This tells how many turns are left."
info6Text4: "In the final turns, you have fewer action points. You can finish building at any time by taking a number. When the counter reaches 0, you must end your turn by taking a number."
