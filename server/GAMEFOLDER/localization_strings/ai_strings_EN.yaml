easy_angry_desc: "This robot has a lot of frustration to take out on the Galaxy. It slaps on some guns and it's ready for launch. Sometimes that strategy even works."
easy_basic_desc: "Basic robot with a balanced skill set. (In other words, it's not very good at anything.)"
easy_random_desc: "One of the easy artificial truckers will be chosen randomly."
easy_rich_desc: "This robot runs a simple algorithm designed to maximize gains. Unfortunately, that is useless without an algorithm to minimize losses."
easy_safe_desc: "Demonstration model designed to teach schoolchildren basic trucker safety: use shields, minimize exposed connectors, wear a helmet, and ignore any statistics saying these things probably won't help much."
medium_angry_desc: "This aggressive robot builds quickly. Its major weakness is that it builds hastily. Also, it sometimes gets an irresistible urge to put itself in a giant slingshot and shoot itself at its enemies."
medium_basic_desc: "An affordable, practical artificial trucker. It can't work miracles, but its balanced algorithms should be adequate for most customers' needs."
medium_random_desc: "One of the standard artificial truckers will be chosen randomly."
medium_rich_desc: "This robot is always prepared with lots of cargo holds. Unlike earlier models, it also remembers to add a few other components as well."
medium_safe_desc: "Safety first. And second. Third, too. In fact, this robot doesn't care where it finishes as long as it finishes in one piece."
hard_angry_desc: "This robot's designers set out to make the most fearsome artificial trucker ever built. They spent 20 percent of their time designing its aggressive AI. They spent the rest of their time designing its intimidating visage."
hard_basic_desc: "Rapid computation and finely balanced decision algorithms. This robot has no weaknesses except, perhaps, its ruthless pursuit of perfection."
hard_random_desc: "One of the tough artificial truckers will be chosen randomly."
hard_rich_desc: "Income-optimizing algorithms combined with intelligent ship design. This robot knows how to turn a profit."
hard_safe_desc: "Access denied. Security clearance required."
