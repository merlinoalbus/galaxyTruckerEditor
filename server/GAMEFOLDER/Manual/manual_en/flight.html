    <a name="flight_days"></a>
    <h3>Gaining and Losing Flight Days</h3>
    
    <p>Some adventures can cause you to lose flight days. Cards that offer rewards have a number in the lower right corner. That is the number of days you will lose if you take the reward. You also might lose flight days when you are trying to navigate a <a href="adventure_cards.html#combat_zone">Combat Zone</a>.</p>
    
    <p>When you lose flight days, your ship moves backward on the flight track. Two ships cannot occupy the same space, so a ship moving backward will leapfrog over ships behind it:</p>
    
    <!--<p class="image_caption">If Blue loses 3 flight days, he will end up in the space just in front of Red.</p>-->

    <br />-->
    
    <p>Similarly, when a ship <b>gains</b> flight days, it moves forward, leapfrogging over ships ahead of it. Your chance to gain flight days is <a href="adventure_cards.html#open_space">Open Space</a>.</p>
    
    <div class="small_window">
    <p>Sometimes you want to be ahead and sometimes you don't.</p>
    
    <p>The leader always gets first choice of any rewards. These rewards come with a penalty of lost flight days. Sometimes you might want to reject a reward to keep yourself ahead of other players.</p>
    
    <p>Players who are ahead have to fight <a href="adventure_cards.html#enemies">enemies</a> first. This is good if you can defeat the enemies, but bad if they can defeat you. Players who are ahead also lose ties in <a href="adventure_cards.html#combat_zone">Combat Zones</a>. Sometimes, it might be advantageous to be behind other players.</p>
    
    <p>If you survive to the end of the flight, your <a href="journeys_end.html#finishing_bonus">finishing bonus</a> will be better if you are farther ahead. So it's always good to be ahead after the last adventure is done.</p>

    <h3>Gaining Goods</h3>
    
    <img class="component_left" src="../../tutorial/infoCargoImg.png" />
    <p>When an adventure card enables you to load goods onto your ship, you may <span class="drag_and_drop">drag them from the dialog box and drop them in your <a href="building_the_ship__cargo_holds.html">cargo containers</a></span>.

      <p>Try to keep your most valuable goods in cargo holds that are least likely to get destroyed during the flight.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Any time you take an opportunity to gain goods, you can also rearrange the goods you already have by <span class="drag_and_drop">dragging them to new containers</span>.</p>
    
    <p>Excess goods have to be dumped into space. <span class="drag_and_drop">You may drag goods from your ship back to the dialog box</span> <span class="tap">or simply click the goods in the containers</span> and they will be moved automatically.</p>
    
    <div class="small_window">

        <br />
    </div>
    
    <img class="component_left" src="../../tutorial/infoCargo2Img.png" />
    <p>Red goods are the most valuable, but they are hazardous materials and must be kept in <a href="building_the_ship__cargo_holds.html#red_containers">red containers</a>, not white ones. Red containers can also hold yellow, green, or blue goods.</p>
</div>



<div class="block">
    <div class="small_window">
        <p>As long as you have enough space, you should take everything you can get, even if you have to put cheap goods in red containers. When you load new goods, you can always rearrange or dump any amount of cargo.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>When you are satisfied with your arrangement of the cargo, <span class="tap">click the <img src="../img/dialog_ok_cropped.png" alt="green check mark" height="16" /> icon to indicate that you are ready to continue.</span></p>
</div>



<div class="block">
    <a name="losing_goods"></a>
    <h3>Losing Goods</h3>
    <p>If a card requires you to give up goods, you will lose the most valuable goods first. The attackers will take these goods automatically and you will not get to choose where they are taken from. If you don’t have enough goods to cover the loss, they will take <a href="building_the_ship__batteries.html"> batteries <img src="../img/battery.png" width="7" /></a> to make up the difference. Once you are out of goods and <a href="building_the_ship__batteries.html"> batteries <img src="../img/battery.png" width="7" /></a>, they can’t take any more from you.</p>
</div> 
 
<div class="block"> 
    <a name="losing_crew"></a>
    <h3>Losing Crew</h3>
    
    <p>Some adventures offer rewards that you can have only if you give up a certain number of crew members. Other adventures penalize you by taking a certain number of crew members. In either case, the game will zoom in on your ship and highlight your crew cabins, allowing you to select which crew members will be given up. <span class="tap">Click a crew cabin to cycle through the possibilities.</span> <a href="building_the_ship__cabins.html#choosing_crew">Aliens</a> also count as crew members and can be given up if you choose.

    <p>If you have no human crew remaining, you will have to <a href="#giving_up">give up on the flight</a> once the adventure card is resolved.</p>
</div>



<div class="block">
    <a name="hits_to_your_ship"></a>
    <h3>Hits to Your Ship</h3>
    
    <p>Your ship will face many dangers. Some of these can actually knock components off your ship! Here is a list of things that can hit you and how you can defend against them:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li> A <a href="adventure_cards.html#small_meteor">small meteor</a> will just bounce off your ship unless it hits an <a href="building_the_ship.html#exposed_connectors">exposed connector</a>. In that case, you must spend 1 <a href="building_the_ship__batteries.html"> battery&nbsp;<img src="../img/battery.png" width="7" /></a> to power a <a href="building_the_ship__shield_generators.html">shield</a> that protects that side or else the component will be destroyed.</li>
    
    <li>A <a href="adventure_cards.html#large_meteor">large meteor</a> will destroy whatever it hits unless you shoot it with a <a href="building_the_ship__cannons.html">cannon</a>.</li>
    
    <li><a href="adventure_cards.html#light_cannon_fire">Light cannon fire</a> can be absorbed by a <a href="building_the_ship__shield_generators.html">shield</a>. This will cost you 1 <a href="building_the_ship__batteries.html"> battery<img src="../img/battery.png" width="7" /></a>. Otherwise the component it hits will be destroyed.</li>
    
    <li><a href="adventure_cards.html#heavy_cannon_fire">Heavy cannon fire</a> just destroys whatever it hits. You have no defense.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If your ship is hit (because you can’t or won’t protect it) the component that was hit is <b>destroyed</b>. This might cause some other components to become disconnected. They drift away into space.</p>
    
    <p>If your ship is broken into two pieces, you decide which piece you will pilot to your destination <span class="tap">by clicking it</span>. The rest of the ship will be lost. Any components that are not attached to the ship when you are done with your flight count as <a href="journeys_end.html#lost_components">components lost along the way</a>.</p>

    <h2>Giving Up</h2>
    
    <p>You might have to give up before you reach your destination. Sometimes you might even choose to give up. This sort of thing happens all the time. Corp Inc. will tow you to one of their warehouses and let you try again.</p>
    
    <p>If you give up:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>You are just a spectator for the rest of the flight and none of the adventures can affect you.</li>
        
        <li>When the <a href="journeys_end.html">flight is finished</a>, you don’t get any bonuses.</li>
        
        <li>Your goods sell at half price.</li>
        
        <li>You still have to pay the penalty for the components you lost along the way.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you are the only one left after everyone else has given up, you can keep going and face the remaining adventures alone. Cards like <a href="adventure_cards.html#combat_zone">Combat Zone</a> and <a href="adventure_cards.html#sabotage">Sabotage</a>, which penalize a player for having the fewest of something, will be ignored.

<div class="block">

    <h3>Losing All Humans</h3>
    
    <p>You have to give up if an adventure card leaves you without any humans on board. (<a href="building_the_ship__alien_life_support.html">Aliens</a> can’t run the ship by themselves.) This could be due to taking a hit that destroys your last occupied <a href="building_the_ship__cabins.html">cabin</a>, to losing crew after encountering a <a href="adventure_cards.html#combat_zone">Combat Zone</a> or <a href="adventure_cards.html#enemies">Slavers</a>, or to voluntarily sending your last crew member off on an <a href="adventure_cards.html#abandoned_ship">Abandoned Ship</a>. If you lose your last human in a <a href="adventure_cards.html#battle_zone">Combat Zone</a>, your ship remains in the flight until all effects of the card have been dealt with.</p>

<div class="block">    
    <a name="open_space_without_engines"></a>
    <h3>Open Space without Engines</h3>
    
    <p>Thanks to inertia, your ship can finish the journey even without engines as long as you don’t encounter <a href="adventure_cards.html#open_space">Open Space</a>. When confronted by an Open Space card, you have to give up if your <a href="building_the_ship__engines.html#engine_strength">engine strength</a> is zero.</p>
