#When revealed part do not fulfill expectations _trustInRevealed is lowered like this( _trustInRevealed -= _trustInRevealed * _settings->trustInRevealedDropConst;). Values closer to 1.0 cause that AI check more revealed parts (will be smarter but takes more computer time). 0.1f is smart enough when trustInRevealedInit == 100.
trustInRevealedDropConst: 0.1   
#When revealed part do not fulfill expectations, expectations should be lowered by small value. (_dropImprovementConst * _settings->revealedExpectationsDropConst). There is almost no delay. Works like we just look at heap of revealed parts and choose the best ones to try on ship.
