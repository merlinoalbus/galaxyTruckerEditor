# ships: 
# rules: Players who made it to the finish do not pay for the lost components – instead, they get 2 for each. If one player gets most this way, he gets another 5 for the best story. Whoever has to give up, pays as usually, though!
# tiles:  
# cards: Very strong supercards. They are always shuffled in the visible cards. There is 1 supercard in the first flight, 2 supercards in the second and 3 supercards in the third.
